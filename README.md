# Musicbox ðŸŽ¶

**Musicbox** is a web application that lets users catalog and review music albums, similar to how IMDb or Letterboxd works for movies. Users can save albums they've listened to, write reviews, and rate them. The application is designed to make it easy to organize music experiences and discover new albums through a social network of music lovers.
